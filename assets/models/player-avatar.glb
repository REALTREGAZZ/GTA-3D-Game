This is a placeholder file for the Dark Souls inspired player avatar.
The actual 3D model should be created using Blender or other 3D software
and exported as a GLB file with the following characteristics:

- Dark Souls inspired knight/warrior
- Medieval armor with damage/wear
- Height: ~2 meters
- Includes animations: idle, walk, run, attack, dodge
- Proper rigging for animations
- Dark, menacing aesthetic

For now, the game uses a programmatically generated Dark Souls style avatar
through the dark-souls-avatar.js module.
